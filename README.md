# LA_Police_Stop_Data
Exploring LA Police Stop Data 2010-Present

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to explore Los Angeles City Police Stop Data from 2010-2019 and see what differences exist between races.
Because there is currently a national conversation happening around policing and race, I thought it would be interesting to look at city-level data. 
In my exploration, I aim to answer these three questions: 
1. Are certain races stopped at higher rates? Has this changed over time?
2. Do stop rates differ between races based on the type of stop or time of day?
3. Are there disparities in “post stop activity” — whether or not an officer will frisk, search, cite, or arrest the person they stopped? Has this changed over time?

## File Description
The Police_Stops.ipynb file is how I explored the data and created the graphs. 

## Results
1. Black stops occur 3.5 times more often than white stops, when controlling for population differences. Stops of Hispanic people occur 1.2 times more often than stops of white people.
2. Pedestrian stops of black people among occur 5.7 times more often than for white people. Vehicle stops of black people occur 3 times that of white people. Stops of Hispanic people occur a little more often than stops of white people.
3. Yes. Stops of people of Multiple Descents result in post stop activity 40% of the time. For Black people, this occurs 34% of time. For Hispanic people, 30% of the time. White stops result in post stop activity 17% of the time.
